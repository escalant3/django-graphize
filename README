Graphize it's a django application that adds a new functionality
to the manage.py script that exports the selected models from sql
to graphical format (a Pajek file).

Disclaimer:
This software is under hard development.

Configuration:
Just add the graphize app to your settings.py file and create a
graphize_settings.py in the root of your django project directory.

You may include in this file all the models you want to graphize in
a dictionary called "graph_structure". Each element of the dictionary
is a tuple that in this first version just includes an element with
another dictionary that specifies aditional fields that we want to 
add to a specific element.

A sample code could be:

from app1.models import Model1, Model2
from app2.models import ModelA, ModelB
from creators.models import Creator, School


MODEL_1_EXTRA_DATA = {'type': 'model1'}

graph_structure = {Model1: (MODEL_1_EXTRA_DATA,),
                    Model2: ({},),
                    ModelA: ({},),
                    ModelB: ({},),
                    }

Usage:
Run from your django project directory:
# python manage.py graphize
